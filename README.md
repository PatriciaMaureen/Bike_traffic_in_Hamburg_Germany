# Bike traffic in Hamburg (Germany)

# Context
The dataset includes comprehensive traffic data from all locations in Hamburg where bicycle traffic is recorded by infrared detectors 24 hours a day, every day of the year. This data collection effort ensures continuous and detailed monitoring of bicycle traffic patterns across the city.

# Goal
My goal was to gain predict bike raffic in Hamburg on a daily basis. Therefore I combined it with weather data. I wanted to explore the following points:
1. Do more people cycle during the week than the weekend?
2. When are the rushhours during the day? 
3. Do more people cycle in summer than in winter?
4. Do more people cycle when the weather is nice?

# Outlook
- Group counting points into two categories: city center and outer districts, conduct separat analyses for each group
- Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the hourly data, incorporating hourly rain data
